<h2>Description</h2>
The 2022 Statistical Restoration is the first computer-generated text derived directly from the earliest manuscript witnesses using an algorithmic statistical model to simulate a reasoned-eclecticism approach, weighing both external and internal evidence in an objective manner. The external evidence is based on statistical reliability, earliness, and diversity of support, and the internal evidence is based on word probabilities within a variant unit and consideration of variant patterns. This process provides a consistently-weighed text without human bias that is both scientifically inspectable and reproducible, and yet still has close agreement to our best modern critical texts.
